 1. I have implemented all work correctly, including building the index.html, resume.html, bio.html writing style.css to make the website with different styles (at least 5 rules). The web coding passed HTML5 and CSS specifications based on the requirements, and I commit to the repository correctly such that the website can be easily accessed. 
 
 2. I did not collaborate or discuss with other students.   
 
 3, I spent approximately 9 hours on the lab. # kristinyanah.github.io
